Level 1, 

Get the data set
*The USGS provides earthquake data in a number of different formats, updated every 5 minutes
*The "All Earthquakes from the Past 7 Days" data set was selected from the USGS GeoJSON Feed page
*The data was given in JSON format which was used to pull in the data for the visualization

Import & Visualize the Data
Create a map using Leaflet that plots all of the earthquakes from the data set based on their longitude and latitude.
data markers should reflect the magnitude of the earthquake by their size and and depth of the earth quake by color. 
Include popups that provide additional information about the earthquake when a marker is clicked.
Create a legend that will provide context for your map data.


Level2,

Pull in Tectonic Plates data set
Visualize it along side the original set of data
Add a number of base maps to choose from
Separate out the two different data sets (earthquakes and tectonic plates) into overlays that can be turned on and off independently
Add layer controls to the map
